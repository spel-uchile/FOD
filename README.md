# Femto-satellite Orbital Deployer (FOD)

This repository contains the PCB design and the source code of a femto-satellite orbital deployer or FOD. This device works by cutting a fishing line with Nichrome wire. The fishing line is normally pressing a hinge lever. When the line is cut, the hinge lever is released end the microcontroller can detect the release status.

The PCB has a transceiver (NRF24L01) to communicate with the femto-satellite once it is released. There is also a LED showing the release status, and a reset button. The energy and the comunication with the OBC is done through a molex cable with a picoblade connector.

This new version is designed for CubeSats of 2U or more. It is intended to be used as a type A interstage panel, so that it leaves more space inside the CubeSat for other payloads.

Current version: 4.0.0
